Lucas Kuzma is founder of The Strange Agency, a consultancy specializing in mobile application development and creative coding. Lucas was introduced to HTML 1.0 at the Digital Media Lab while an undergrad at CWRU and has since spent over 20 years designing and developing interactive experiences for web and mobile. He has led teams focused on audiovisual interaction, scalable cloud infrastructure, e-commerce, and retail support. His love of creative coding has generated over a million App Store downloads, and he has performed at numerous venues from San Francisco to Berlin. Perpetually eager to learn, Lucas holds a BS in Computer Science, a BA in Philosophy, an MFA in Design | Media Art, and an MS in Information, Communication and Audiovisual Media Technologies. Also eager to teach, Lucas has lectured on both design and programming at USC and UCLA.

Skills include: iOS Development, Music Analysis, Sound Synthesis, Swift, Objective C, C, Processing, ActionScript, JavaScript, Python, PHP, SQL, AWS, Heroku, Docker, Magento

Lucas Kuzma investigates human-machine co-creativity through generative systems that produce forms neither human design nor machine training could achieve alone. His practice combines hand-tuned procedural algorithms with fine-tuned diffusion models, creating hybrid organisms he presents as specimens from parallel evolutionary pathways, what he terms "xenobotanical experiments." Each piece emerges from a two-stage process where procedural geometry collides with learned visual vocabularies, forcing the model to improvise morphological bridges between incompatible ontologies. Kuzma holds an MFA in Design | Media Art from UCLA and an MS in Audiovisual Media Technologies from Universitat Pompeu Fabra, with decades of work spanning generative AI, computer vision, and algorithmic design. His work questions authorship, agency, and taxonomic authority in an era of synthetic biology and machine intelligence. He publishes through Terminal Archive and runs The Strange Agency.
