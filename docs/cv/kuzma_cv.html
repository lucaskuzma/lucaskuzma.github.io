                    Thesis: Created a neural network of autonomous, sound-making
                    devices interacting with each other and with the sounds in
                    their environment. Programmed all devices in C, using Atmel
                    AVR microprocessors. Designed all circuitry. Used the
                    Processing environment to create simulations of the network.
